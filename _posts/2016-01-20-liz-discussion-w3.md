#Discussion Questions, Week 3
##Monday
No class.

##Wednesday
* In the reading on Digital Mappaemundi the authors mentioned features of plans for features that addressed each of the scholarly primitives we have discussed previously. I've noticed a trend, between the Mirador Github issues, this reading, and technology generally  toward expecting one platform/application to address all our needs-- is this desirable? 
** Is it defeatist to say there are problems that aren't worth trying to solve, at least until there is a complete overhaul of the current approach? When is it okay to give up on a project?
* What can physical annotation do that the tools we've seen so far does not replicate sufficiently? Are these tools still working to replace physical annotation, or strictly building on it?
