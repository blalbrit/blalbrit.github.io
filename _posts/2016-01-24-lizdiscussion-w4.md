#Discussion Questions, Week 4
##Monday
* How does (or should) transcription handle non-textual elements of a page (filled intertextual space or illustrations, for example)? Should it address these at all?
* How do we transcribe abbreviations for which we do not know the expansion?

##Wednesday
No questions for today.
