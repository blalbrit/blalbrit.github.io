#Exercise 2: Annotating
<DRAFT>
* Question: Who writes what, where?

Recently my interests have turned toward marginalia in manuscripts and early print books. Writing and drawing in the margins keeps books alive, show active participation in the text by humans. I am interested in who writes what, and where. Is most marginal writing part of the text, written by the scribe? Do readers tend to write more in the outer or lower margins? When readers are writing, is it more often than not related to the text they are reading?
