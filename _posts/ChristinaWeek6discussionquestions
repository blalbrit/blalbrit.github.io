Week 6 -- Discussion questions
(1) How might we define "data"? Or, perhaps more productively, what does data not encompass?
(2) In the 'conclusions' section of this writing on 'Linked Data,' the author makes mention of major companies (Google, Yahoo, Facebook) who are "busy building such data spaces." It says here that in contrast to the open Web--accessible to everyone--these "emerging data spaces are controlled by single companies which also decide how the data spaces are exploited."  Isn't this a bit worrisome?  What happens when certain companies have a 'monopoly' on information? (This may be a broad question, but it got me thinking about the limits of this...)
