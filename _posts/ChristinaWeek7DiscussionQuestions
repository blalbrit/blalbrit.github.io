Week 7 Discussion Questions

(Sorry if this is a repeat--I posted these last night, but now can't seem to find where they are on GitHub. Thankfully I'd taken a screenshot of them in case something happened!)

1.  On "Tooling up for the digital humanities"/Data visualization/4: Communication and Storytelling-- Here we read that visualization is about transparency, about letting people explore and examine your source data. The article mentions that there's a trend, as of late, to expose the underlying dataset so that your users can download it and use it further.  Why *wouldn't* you want to do this, other than if your information is top-secret?  What holds one back from doing this?  (I guess this could have some of the same pros/cons as open source software, too).

2.  In the article on "Demystifying Networks" we read that humanities face problems from the outset with networks--because our data doesn't fit neatly into one category or another (or at least it doesn't usually). This is sort of a broad question, but where are most of the tools digital medievalists are using being developed?  And who is developing them?  (Here I think to libraries, such as Stanford's). We've talked a lot about providing feedback as to how well certain projects/programs work when they're actually used by medievalists to answer medieval reserach questions.  But how close to the core of these programs are medievalists going, on a whole?  This is probably worded really poorly--I'll ask more specifically in person.
