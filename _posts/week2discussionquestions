# Discussion question, Week 2
## The first question deals with how we decide upon our digital priorities: Unsworth says that while we can create all the software we want, but without it being “developed and tested in the context of real scholarly use” it can be useless.  Furthermore, he warns against “customization, because purpose-built or project-centered software is unlikely to provide broad support for functional primitives.”  This claim makes sense, yet how is it best put to action in the ‘real-world’?  For example, does every scholar working on Blake manuscripts (which Unsworth makes mention of in his talk on Inote) need to have a process by which they ‘try out’ a specific digital archive, so we can have as large a sample set of scholars as we can, trying out certain software?  This got me to thinking about the nature of the digital humanities.  It seems we often make software, or rework an old online repository, to fulfill a specific need—or to advance a certain university’s (or professor’s) specific project.  But what happens to other material that won’t be touched, or that doesn’t garner the digital attention that other material gets?  I understand that we must start somewhere—and that somewhere is better than nowhere—but how do we determine our priorities in digitizing and creating new software?
