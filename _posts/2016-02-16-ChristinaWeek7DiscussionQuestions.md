# Week 7 discussion questions--Christina (Sampling & Illustrating)

1.) If Voyant is an "environment," how might one carry what is used from it into papers?  (i.e.: in order to take advantage of Voyant's capabilites, do you really have to always be in the program itself---or what does it look like exported?)

2.) Is it true that Voyant *only* works with text? (copying and pasting text into a field--rather than Voyant being able to decipher a manuscript itself). This poses what challenges? Benefits?
