## Exercise 1

####Retail manuscript sites

Charles Edwin Puckett — https://www.cepuckett.com
* leaves only, richly described.
* Medium sized images only, poor treatment of multiple images (overlapping buyers illustration only)
* Philip J. Pirages — https://www.pirages.com
* mixture of manuscript leaves, few books. 
* rich set of descriptive categories for browsing, but they were inoperative

Griffons Medieval Manuscripts — http://www.griffons.com/
* “Affordable Renaissance Art…”
* Poor categorization

Sanderus Antiquariat — https://www.sanderusmaps.com
* Individual leaves and cuttings

####Digital Manuscripts

Monastic Manuscript Project — http://www.earlymedievalmonasticism.org/
* Grant funded project at Syracuse University
* Gathers information about projects and site related to the digization and study of manuscripts
* Hundreds of links show how scattered often just a very few resources are
* Nothing there to work on discovery across the aggregated resources or to categorize/describe contents

Clairvaux Virtual LIbrary — https://www.bibliotheque-virtuelle-clairvaux.com/
* “All indexed manuscript” but no mention of how many
* Advanced search, no simple keywords, no auto-complete
* Facets appear only for search results
* Viewer (branded) by Mediatheque, Grand Troyes (coalition of libraries/archives)
