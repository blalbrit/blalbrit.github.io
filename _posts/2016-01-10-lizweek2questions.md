#Discussion Questions, Week 2

## Monday

* Unsworth gives 7 "scholarly primatives":  Discovering, Annotating, Comparing, Referring, Sampling, Illustrating, and Representing. Discovering, annotating, comparing, referring, and sampling are intuitive enough, but what is the difference between illustrating and representing in this context?

* "information that is for all intents and purposes lost... [content] produced using computers or operating systems that ultimately lost out to more popular competitors" This line in the O'Donnell reading got me thinking-- are we on our way to a more stable technological situation, or is standardization a false sense of security?
	* What exactly is meant by "unnegotiated interactions"? He says, "Developers produce content assuming users will be able to process it; users access content assuming it will be suitable for use with their processors." Is this just another way of talking about standarization?
