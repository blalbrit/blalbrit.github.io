###Discussion Questions / Thoughts
Some thoughts on the readings:
Can any online resource really be said to be "future-proof?" How can we tell what standards will survive, and which won't?

I was absolutely blown away by Deborah Parker's project on Dante's Inferno that Unsworth's article mentioned, considering this was 2000. As an avid video game player, I'm always excited by projects that use visualization technology, and I was also impressed that it was backwards and forwards-compatible with other standards. I was curious if there's been any inroads on applying VR technology to humanities studies (for example, visualizing Dante's inferno similar to the Parker project, or even depicting how ancient cities may have looked)?

Finally, some unrelated material:  
On the collapse of standards, the [2038 Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) refers to the inability of 32-bit systems to store a time after January 17th, 2038 on their system clocks. This could potentially cause a nuclear catastrophe. Similar to my first question--how do we make things future-proof?

On a less catastrophic note, check out [two monks](http://the-toast.net/2016/04/14/two-monks-invent-art/), from The Toast.
