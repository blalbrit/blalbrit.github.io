Week 4 Discussion Questions (continued from Week 3's, which mention our other readings)--Transcription
*Note: this deals with Middle English transcriptions, not Latin. Are there slightly different things we have to consider when transcribing Latin/languages that are *not* in English? (This also leads to the question if T-PEN is meant mostly for OE/ME and Latin; It seems to be this way considering the "Latin dictionary" tool at the bottom of the transcription window and the fact that there are shortcuts for thorn, etc.).

1.) Is there a way that we can distinguish between transcribing glosses versues transcribing main text?  Perhaps this will become more clear to me as we use T-PEN in the following weeks.
2.) How much do we describe letterforms and scribal hand when we transcribe? (cf. rubrication; making mention of a particuarly interesting abbreviation/macron before we expand it; explaining the particular characteristics of a series of serifs--those "lozenge-shaped decorative finishes")? I assume this would go into what T-PEN calls the "notes" section. The main caveat, however, that I can think of is that we wouldn't want the notes to come up in the same window as the pure transcription--for that could distract from the main body of the text proper.  Is there a way to 'hide' the "notes" feature in T-PEN? (Again, this may be an obvious question, but as someone new to using T-PEN this is on my mind!).
