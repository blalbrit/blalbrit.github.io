   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-post-annotations-and-transcriptions&quot;&gt;Blog Post Annotations and Transcriptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For annotating and transcribing, I selected science and medicine manuscripts because the content peaked my interest.  Once I identified them for inclusion in the Mirador instance for class, I panicked, worried that selecting manuscripts for this task based upon the content might have been a bad idea. Turns out the reason for my worries was because I didn’t think I would be able to make useful annotations or be able to transcribe the text because of my inexperience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;annotating&quot;&gt;Annotating&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selected a Medical treatise from the 13th century because the text has three different scripts.  I started annotating with tags indicating the script.  The manuscript is a  bi-folio with two columns per page so I wasn’t sure how to indicate which column the selected text was in.  Then I was trying to figure out if it was worth indicating which column and/or side of the bi-folio for tagging.  I did not create any annotations because I’m still not sure exactly what I am looking at in the text.  I believe once I start transcribing the text, I may have some information to add as annotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;transcribing&quot;&gt;Transcribing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started looking at transcribing what I have indicated as script2 in the 13th century Medical treatise.  I selected this text because the font is bigger and easier to read.  However, my first attempt at transcribing was not successful.  I am finding that I still am looking at the text as I would an English language text.  It is going to take much more practice and help from others in the class to be able to complete the transcription.  Transcription is an art form and I have to remind myself that, like any new skill, it takes time to learn.  I was discouraged and my worries about not having Latin language skills surfaced along with my imposter syndrome.  But I will continue to work on improving my skills because I know I can.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>DLCL122-2016 - Christina&#39;s Blog Post, Exercise 2</title>
   <link href="http://blalbrit.github.io/2016/01/24/Christinablogpost2"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christina’s Blog post on exercise 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In embarking upon exercise 2—which involved utilizing Mirador to digitally annotate folia held in Stanford’s online repository—I was initially skeptical of the program’s benefits.  Indeed, it impressed me that you could store annotations for others to use, reference, or edit in future, but other than that I was unsure about the merits of Mirador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after using it myself to begin digitally annotating the illuminated capitals of Stanford’s c.1450 Book of Hours and Psalter (with prayers ascribe to Saint Jerome and the Venerable Bede), my mind was changed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone trained in rigorous visual analysis—something instilled in me by countless medieval art historians—Mirador allowed me to look at the mis-en-page and iconographic program of a codex’s folio in a new light.  For example, as I spent time a fair bit of time looking at folio 13 (the first digitized folio of the MS), I was struck anew thinking about what—and how—I wanted to annotate.  Mirador’s relatively easy-to-use user interface permitted me to engage with the illuminated capitals of this folio in a way I had never done before.  It’s easy ‘tag’ feature made me think about how I would characterize certain decoration, letter size, and style.  I had never before had to think about making annotations consistent and understandable to a viewer other than myself—for that is how one would interact with my annotations normally, since I wouldn’t be able to explain them in person!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Mirador’s side-by-side comparative feature is wonderfully useful.  In fact, I wish every digital repository allowed one to do this! Viewing annotations for various folia within one manuscript, or across differing manuscripts, holds immense value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, one of the most difficult elements of trying to digitally annotate the illuminated capitals of this 1450 Book of Hours and Psalter was the fact that I didn’t know precisely how much information I should include.  At a certain point, tags (and even writing annotations within the text box) become no longer useful if there is simply &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much information to wade through.  In this, the ‘bold’ text feature in the text box can be used to usefully pull apart key words and terms for the casual viewer, as they engage with an illuminated initial you’ve spent much time with.  (The ‘italic’ option for text has its own problems, probably a bug—for it doesn’t allow you to make text italic and instead hides the annotation frame altogether).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, digitally annotating using the Mirador program made me rethink how I approach study of a medieval manuscript’s visual layout—down to its most basic level.  Digitally annotating on Mirador forces the annotator to make decisions about how they will categorize what they see so that it can be (hopefully) easily searchable and usable in contexts not just within a given manuscript…but also across manuscripts.  I look forward to using the Mirador tool a LOT more, not just in our projects for this class, but in my future work as a medievalist-in-training.  In fact, I think that using Mirador would be a good exercise whenever I engage in an essay or project in which I need to closely-look (which should be almost any visually-centered endeavor).  Through the very act of having to make decisions on what you mention (or do not mention) in annotations, one is forced to engage with the text and image in a more active manner.  Using Mirador, in conjunction with viewing the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; manuscript (if one can), can help us as medievalists not only track and utilize our obversations later on, but also help us to question why we make certain distinctions (or not) and why these may—or may not—be important.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Week 4 Discussion Questions (continued from Week 3’s, which mention our other readings)–Transcription
&lt;em&gt;Note: this deals with Middle English transcriptions, not Latin. Are there slightly different things we have to consider when transcribing Latin/languages that are *not&lt;/em&gt; in English? (This also leads to the question if T-PEN is meant mostly for OE/ME and Latin; It seems to be this way considering the “Latin dictionary” tool at the bottom of the transcription window and the fact that there are shortcuts for thorn, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Is there a way that we can distinguish between transcribing glosses versues transcribing main text?  Perhaps this will become more clear to me as we use T-PEN in the following weeks.
2.) How much do we describe letterforms and scribal hand when we transcribe? (cf. rubrication; making mention of a particuarly interesting abbreviation/macron before we expand it; explaining the particular characteristics of a series of serifs–those “lozenge-shaped decorative finishes”)? I assume this would go into what T-PEN calls the “notes” section. The main caveat, however, that I can think of is that we wouldn’t want the notes to come up in the same window as the pure transcription–for that could distract from the main body of the text proper.  Is there a way to ‘hide’ the “notes” feature in T-PEN? (Again, this may be an obvious question, but as someone new to using T-PEN this is on my mind!).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>DLCL122-2016 - Liz&#39;s Blog Post, Exercise 2</title>
   <link href="http://blalbrit.github.io/2016/01/23/lizblog2"/>
   <updated>2016-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;exercise-2-annotating&quot;&gt;Exercise 2: Annotating&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently my interests have turned toward marginalia in manuscripts and early print books. Writing and drawing in the margins keeps books alive, show active participation in the text by humans. I am interested in who writes what, and where. Is most marginal writing part of the text, written by the scribe? Do readers tend to write more in the outer or lower margins? When readers are writing, is it more often than not related to the text they are reading?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin exploring these questions, I browsed thorugh Stanford’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://exhibits.stanford.edu/mss/browse/browse-all&quot;&gt;digitized manuscript collection&lt;/a&gt;. Early on it became clear that legibility and my own paleographical experience would be a limiting factor, as often I found marginalia unreadable. I selected 10 items which appeared to have the most legible and interesting marginalia at a cursory glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original plan was to use Mirador to tag instances of marginalia (and only tag– the only written description I might want would be a transcription of the marginalia, which will come in a later exercise), based on categorizations I encountered while reading Stephen Orgel’s &lt;em&gt;The Reader in the Book&lt;/em&gt;, plus a few of my own. These categories were active reading (a reader leaving comments on a text), correction (a scribe or reader correcting the text), recording (making note of something unrelated to the text, such as a business transaction), structural (text/symbols that are part of the structure of the text, such as section numbering), and illustration (doodles, maniculae, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied with the coverage of my categories, I set off to tag. Right away I found it quite difficult to fit what I was seeing on the page into the categories, not because the categories were insufficient but because, as previously feared, my ability to read the text was limiting progress. While I had done well to choose the most legible examples I could find in the collection, making out characters was still a challenge, and my minimal knowledge of Latin was doing me no favors. Structural elements and illustration were easy to pick out, but corrections, recordings, and active reading I found near indistinguishable. Without writing out a full transcription of everything I found, I was getting nowhere fast. Since transcription is to be done in the coming weeks, I changed my strategy. Rather than tagging based on my original categories, I tagged (and re-tagged) based on whether the marginalia appeared to be scribal or non-scribal. This, too, was not as easy as it might be for someone with more paleographic experience; I am satisfied that what I have is &lt;em&gt;close enough&lt;/em&gt; for this initial step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this exerise is not quite what I desired before starting, but I have been able to make a couple of observations so far. First, that most of the marginal writing in these items appears to be non-scribal. This is in line with what I would have predicted– I would assume that more often than not if a scribe had something to say or correct, it would be in the body of the text. Second, what I did not expect to see (or did not think to expect) is that scribal writing appears more frequenty in the left and right margins, and is less likely to be written in a way that is not in line with the appearance of the page (upside down, or sideways, for example). After transcription I hope to be able to explore the reasons behind these observations, and inch closer to my original categorization scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;week-3-discussion-questions&quot;&gt;Week 3 discussion questions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Clemens and Graham’s chapter on correction, glossing, and annotation talks about the scribal tools and techniques involved in the “nitty-gritty” elements of manuscript production. As someone new to digital renditions of manuscripts (having transcribed them solely by hand in the past) how do digital humanists usually account for erasures and re-writing over those marked-out areas?  If we believe a medieval scribe to have made the error of “eyeskip” (which C&amp;amp;G define as omitting the same word, phrase, or sequence of letters that appear twice in close succession) how can we make note of this in our digital annotation?&lt;br /&gt;
—-And now a question of glossing: do we treat the location of where certain glosses are (cf. glossae collectae–those fully separate from the text itself; interlinear glosses; glosses in the main text) and what type they are (lexical/synonym vs. suppletive/omissions) &lt;em&gt;differently&lt;/em&gt; when we go into annotating them digitally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Digital Mappaemundi (Maps of the World) disusses the use of digital ‘layers,’ whereby “different research questions involving a single image may be addressed separately through annotation (also allowing one to choose precisely how &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; layers they would like to view at one time). This seems to present a solution to our frustration with the BL’s excess of metadata in lengthy, sometimes-bordering-upon-impenetrable, paragraphs. How common are digital layers in literary manuscripts?  As its name suggests, the Mappaemundi project focuses on maps mostly.
—-Think more about: Geospatial bias and how it can relate to literary/biblical/philosophical texts too? (cf. C&amp;amp;G’s term “archaeology of the book” and idea of the book as a space)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;In the reading on Digital Mappaemundi the authors mentioned features of plans for features that addressed each of the scholarly primitives we have discussed previously. I’ve noticed a trend, between the Mirador Github issues, this reading, and technology generally  toward expecting one platform/application to address all our needs– is this desirable?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it defeatist to say there are problems that aren’t worth trying to solve, at least until there is a complete overhaul of the current approach? When is it okay to give up on a project?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What can physical annotation do that the tools we’ve seen so far does not replicate sufficiently? Are these tools still working to replace physical annotation, or strictly building on it?&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;week-2-discussion-questions-christina&quot;&gt;Week 2 discussion questions (Christina)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the words of Hilmo, “Medieval reading often included looking, in a non-linear, holistic way, at all the components of the page.”  The overall theme of Hilmo’s essay is on the centrality of the visual—images—in the medieval mind.  Hilmo speaks of how images can, and should, be read as text (cf. the monastic practice of ruminatio, per Bede’s 8th-c. account of Caedmon), as something which requires unpacking and a peeling-back of layers.  How might this relate to our discussion of the tasks involved in annotation and transcription?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Moreover: To the medieval mind an image was an animative, performative presence to be decoded and ruminated upon (particularly with the rise of mendicant orders).  This usually involved having a ‘toolkit’ of symbolism and connections at the ready. How might we, as modern viewers, recreate this ‘toolkit’ of connections through our digital presenting of manuscripts?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do we need to take into account the basic genre of a manuscript (sacred, secular, somewhere-in-between) when creating a digital tool for studying it?  In other words, Hilmo’s essay deals with manuscripts containing visual images–something usually restricted to the domain of art historians.  How might the technologies we produce for medieval objects (the codex, in particular) tread the line between being produced for scholars of text versus scholars of image? (The text v. image comparison is one made frequently in medieval studies–whereby text becomes image, and image becomes text).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aside: Has there been a digital survey of iconophobic evidence in western manuscripts (British, Carolingian…and Byzantine, if we head into eastern MSs)?  Ie: smudgings out of eyes, etc.  I began to think along these terms because a) it’s the topic of my thesis and b) Hilmo’s essay begins with, essentially, a brief survey of western (and some eastern–Byzantium, Islamic) concern over the ‘power’ invested in images.&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;week2-discussion-questions&quot;&gt;Week2 discussion questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first question deals with how we decide upon our digital priorities: Unsworth says that while we can create all the software we want, but without it being “developed and tested in the context of real scholarly use” it can be useless.  Furthermore, he warns against “customization, because purpose-built or project-centered software is unlikely to provide broad support for functional primitives.”  This claim makes sense, yet how is it best put to action in the ‘real-world’?  For example, does every scholar working on Blake manuscripts (which Unsworth makes mention of in his talk on Inote) need to have a process by which they ‘try out’ a specific digital archive, so we can have as large a sample set of scholars as we can, trying out certain software?  This got me to thinking about the nature of the digital humanities.  It seems we often make software, or rework an old online repository, to fulfill a specific need—or to advance a certain university’s (or professor’s) specific project.  But what happens to other material that won’t be touched, or that doesn’t garner the digital attention that other material gets?  I understand that we must start somewhere—and that somewhere is better than nowhere—but how do we determine our priorities in digitizing and creating new software?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To quote O’Donnell, “Technology ages faster than information.”  O’Donnell gives a fairly balanced perspective on the positives and negatives of digital scholarship in the medieval realm.  One of his most interesting examples, the Electronic Domesday Book—initiated by the BBC—turned out to be a catastrophic failure.  It was not only too expensive for its target audience and was also designed for certain computers only, both elements that condemned it to its own obsolescence.  This is a rather large question to tackle, but how can we work to make sure we don’t produce ‘failures’ of this sort, schemes where vast quantities of time, energy, and money seem to be wasted in the end?  O’Donnell’s overall impression of Wikipedia seems quite positive, illumining his opinion that collaboration is the key to solving many of these problems.  Do repositories and databases, then, need to have a way in which users can collaborate and edit—like Wikipedia?  What do we sacrifice with regards to accuracy and legitimacy when doing so?  Is it worth it?&lt;/li&gt;

   <link href="http://blalbrit.github.io/2016/01/11/lizblog1"/>
   <updated>2016-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://blalbrit.github.io/2016/01/11/lizblog1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;exercise-1-discovering&quot;&gt;Exercise 1: Discovering&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this exercise, I examined both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;British Library’s digitized manuscripts viewer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wamcp.bibalex.org/&quot;&gt;Wellcome Arabic Manuscripts Online&lt;/a&gt;. As a part-time computer scientist, the user interface of each repository is what grabbed my attention– let’s begin with a brief overview of the features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;british-library&quot;&gt;British Library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manuscripts can be searched for by keyword, date range, shelfmark, title, author or scribe, provenance, and/or bibliography. Searching returns a thumbnail, shelfmark, date, and brief description for every manuscript found, and the results sortable by shelfmark, author, title, or date (interestingly, not sortable by all the potential search parameters). Alternatively, manuscripts can be browsed by shelfmark, author, scribe, or title. When browsing, the user is presented with a list of every manuscript, sorted by the selected field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once choosing a particular manuscript, search and browse both put you to that manuscript’s description page. This page offers the expected metadata, when available: shelfmark, content description, dates, a thumbnail image, language, location, author, title, provenance, a bibliography. For many manuscripts, much of this information is missing– either unknown or simply not supplied (in the case of a content or physical description).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the thumbnail leads to the image viewer. This is one area that leaves much to be desired. The controls to navigate through the manuscript are placed at the top right, while a different set of controls to manipulate the current image (limited to full screen and zoom) are located lower on the left. There is some sort of page header without a clear function, and only one object can be viewed at a time (leaving it to the intrepid user to open multiple browser windows themselves).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wellcome-arabic-manuscripts-online&quot;&gt;Wellcome Arabic Manuscripts Online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wellcome website is, from the start, much less welcoming than the British Library site. The design looks quite clunky and dated. It also presents a search tool on the homepage, but the functionality is hit or miss. Manuscripts in the browse view can be filtered by approximate date, librarian date, scribal date, decorations, and language; they can be browsed by shelfmark, author, title, colophon, tahmid, scribe, and mistra height. The distinction between a search-like way of finding a text and browsing a bit fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On selecting a particular manuscript, both the metadata for that object and the image viewer are presented, side-by-side. Metadata is tabbed into a summary, content description, physical description, and history. The viewer displays thumbnail navigation on the side, and a scrolling-view of the larger images in the main portion of the window. It also offers the option to download the current image in a variety of formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the Wellcome experience stands out in its ability to display two different objects side-by-side in a single window. After viewing one manuscript, all other manuscripts in the search or browse results will display a button which says “Compare with &lt;first manuscript=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;. This shows two instances of the viewer, with the manuscript metadata pushed below.&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reflection&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When desiging a tool, a  major concer of the developers must be their audience. Who is using the tool should dictate which features are implemented and how simple, or complecated, the user is allowed to make their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would think the target audience of the British Library’s digital collection would be a less scholarly, more “general public” audience (the casual user) than most repositories. They are, afterall, a big institution with a big, recognizable name. The user experience, however, seems to contradict that. The interface is much cleaner than that of the Wellcome collection, for sure, but the steps of getting to the actual viewing of an object might intimidate a casual user. Searching and browsing are straight forward enough. Once on a manuscript description page, though, trouble starts. The more famous manuscripts, especially those highlighted on the home page are more likely to be viewed by a casual user. Those are also precicely the manuscripts for which the description is monstrously intimidating. Impenetrable walls of text describing every detail of the object are not inviting to a casual user. If they do make it past that to the viewer, it feels odd and dated, with less than desirable controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wellcome collection, on the other hand, I would not expect to be friendly to those not versed in the subject. It is a very particular set of manuscripts, all Arabic texts dealing with health and medicine, not exactly the sort of thing a casual user would seek out. The target audience is very specifically scholars interested in Arabic manuscripts about medicine, so it is fair of the design to assume a knowledgable audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it? When a tool is made publiclly available on the internet, there is no telling who will be using it. The target audience in mind during development may turn out not to be the audience reached, at all. In the case of the British Library, they may very well have intended for the experience to be pleasant for the general public as well as scholars. Whether or not they succeeded is very subjective, but it does not seem unreasonable to claim they are losing part of that audience with intimidating presentation of information. With Wellcome, they may have only had a small audience in mind, but their manuscript information and image representation is quite friendly and usable for a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is entirely a question of interface design, but it has an impact on how readily people can discover and use texts (or anything) from online repositories. It is my (admittedly untested) opinion that there is always happy medium between functionality and friendliness. The perfect example, from these two repositories, is the difference in handling of metadata. Both supply the same information, but Wellcome hides much of it upfront, sparing a casual visitor from information they don’t care to see, while still allowing easy access to that information for those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to see it. A tool can be full-featured &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; simple to use, if you keep in mind that you have no gaurantees of your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://blalbrit.github.io/2016/01/11/BlogPost1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-post-1-taken-from-practical-exercise-1&quot;&gt;Blog Post 1 (taken from Practical Exercise 1)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;christina-smith&quot;&gt;Christina Smith&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content, metadata, additional information, one’s ability to interact with the resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s blog post focuses upon two online digital repositories: the British Library’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/&quot;&gt;Digitised Manuscripts Home&lt;/a&gt; and the Bodleian Library’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/medieval/index.html#manuscript&quot;&gt;Electronic Catalogue of Medieval &amp;amp; Renaissance Manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially chose these two because, for the (as of yet) non-digital medievalist in me, they seemed quite opposite in appearance and functionality.  It was after looking into the Bodleian’s Electronic Catalogue of Medieval &amp;amp; Renaissance Manuscripts more that I figured out that it serves as a catalogue—and a somewhat rudimentary one at that, rather than a full-fledged, interactive site (evident if one but compare this electronic catalogue with the Bodleian’s main site).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, it is evident that the British Library’s Digitised Manuscripts Home caters to a different audience than that of the Bodleian’s Electronic Catalogue of Medieval &amp;amp; Renaissance Manuscripts.  The content given on the Bodleian’s catalogue is sparse, its “conventions” laid out in a teal box at the beginning.  Obviously, the site gears towards a user who knows precisely what she is looking for—preferably the manuscript’s shelfmark (since that is the easiest way to search this site).  Clicking on any one of the “Manuscript Collections” is useful inasmuch as it takes you to a simple list of manuscripts with their respective metadata and a few digitized images, if one is lucky.   For example, MS. Barocci 1—the first manuscript listed under the MSS. Barocci collection of Greek manuscripts—has only images from the catalogue (in print form) and quarto.  There are few, if any, images from the folios themselves (for example, MS. Barocci 3), not permitting the user any ability to visually compare across manuscripts.  The metadata is sparse, presented in one strip, and lacking the latest bibliography.  Most bibliographic material dates to the early 1990’s, showing that this site was likely last updated at that time.  Obviously, there’s much scholarly work that’s been done since then!  When one clicks upon the folios, they are poorly scanned and one can’t zoom in or use toolbars as is possible on the British Library site, showing that the site is designed for quick usage, perhaps only useful for acquiring date, language, and shelfmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the British Library’s Digitised Manuscripts Home appeals to a wider, even non-academic audience.  Clearly, this is in line with the British Library’s mission statement as a whole (similar to the British Museum)—that idea that its physical library in London is a museum for the world, a place where visitors can merely ‘stop in’ to view some of Britain’s greatest wonders.  The “Highlights” tab is visually appealing (located on the right hand side of the opening page), admittedly drawing one’s attention to the ‘big hits’ held by the Library—sometimes dangerously eclipsing lesser-known, but equally as important, manuscripts and items.  The “Search” feature on the opening page is most useful for its “Keyword” feature.  The “Date” slider is partially useful.  It certainly looks good—inviting for the casual user—but the functionality payoff is not as great as one would hope.  For one, there’s no information prior to 0CE, and it is also prone to stalling (at least one Macs) because of the large swathe of material it draws from.  In fact, for the casual viewer (even academic, perhaps), it would be more useful to search by region of the world, or to have an interactive date bar in which certain manuscripts were located along a continuum, allowing for immediate visual interaction with the material.  (Perhaps this is the art historically-trained part of me talking now!).  As befitting a major national repository, the British Library’s metadata for a given manuscript is extensive indeed—its content almost a bit too overwhelming.  One can’t isolate one piece of information from another, meaning that she is forced to look at the entire swathe of metadata in one fell swoop.  This includes date, title, content, binding (if possible to view), language, physical description, ownership, and bibliography.  The bibliography of the British Library’s online site—even for lesser-known acquisitions—is impressive indeed.  Perhaps this is a function of the Library’s active connections with current scholars in the field (such as Michelle P. Brown, who both worked and published for/at the British Library), but it also illumines the Library’s emphasis on the spreading of information out into the greater world of advanced, and more casual, learning.  When clicking upon a digital folio, so as to enlarge it, there is an irritating drop-down pane which appears with detail on the content of the manuscript.  It’s an abbreviated version of the extensive metadata on the previous page.  This serves more as a distraction than anything else, particularly when all one wants to do is to go to the navigation panel slightly below this drop-down pane.  (You also can’t click on the red “British Library” banner to go back to the home page—another irritating feature!).  In all, while the British Library’s website is more “glitzy” and aesthetically pleasing, it fails in some crucial components—from these small features to the fact that you can’t easily compare manuscript images with other manuscript images, save from opening new windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Bodleian Library, obviously a much newer online repository than its Electronic Catalogue of Medieval &amp;amp; Renaissance Manuscripts from the 1990’s, opens with images of the binding of a given manuscript.  One chooses between the manuscripts they want from among other ones, located in boxes side-by-side.  This layout is inviting, emphasizing the visual nature of the holdings—something which I mentioned above as being important when we try to recreate objects that necessarily derive meaning from their tactility and functionality as book.  The metadata is wisely included on the side, not taking away from the visual aspect of the page and its scribal hand.  A negative, though, would be that the folios are preserved as single-sheets, rather than as bifolia.  This doesn’t allow the viewer to have the experience of page turning recreated before them.  Nor does it permit the viewer to truly see interactions across the page, across the gutter—something crucial to any study of medieval manuscripts.  I need to think more about this element as I look through more digital repositories—something I haven’t spent much time doing before this class, as I’ve worked more on non-codex archaeological objects.  The Digital Bodleian Library, however, overall seems to be a good compromise between the sparse, almost counter-useful layout of the Electronic Catalogue of Medieval &amp;amp; Renaissance Manuscripts and the overwhelming, somewhat unhelpful structure of the BL’s Digitised Manuscripts Home.  The metadata of the Digital Bodleian Library does not obstruct one from viewing the codex itself, and the navigation is visually appealing and, on the whole, relatively ‘easy’ to use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsworth gives 7 “scholarly primatives”:  Discovering, Annotating, Comparing, Referring, Sampling, Illustrating, and Representing. Discovering, annotating, comparing, referring, and sampling are intuitive enough, but what is the difference between illustrating and representing in this context?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“information that is for all intents and purposes lost… [content] produced using computers or operating systems that ultimately lost out to more popular competitors” This line in the O’Donnell reading got me thinking– are we on our way to a more stable technological situation, or is standardization a false sense of security?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What exactly is meant by “unnegotiated interactions”? He says, “Developers produce content assuming users will be able to process it; users access content assuming it will be suitable for use with their processors.” Is this just another way of talking about standarization?
«««&amp;lt; HEAD

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While reading Hilmo, I found myself thinking more about the act of reading about images than about what was actually being said. Of course not every point can be made by simply showing the image in question; how might we, if we were to produce a new version of this reading in a digital format, improve on the experience?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mirador idea: ability to link annotations to one another.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is not, strictly speaking, a question; it is just something I noticed and would like to discuss.
Taking a page straight from Unsworth’s examples of primitives, I present the following passage from Hilmo, and a deformation of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion-questions-for-the-readings-for-week-1&quot;&gt;Discussion questions for the readings for Week 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham, “Manuscript Description,” in &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Manuscript Studies&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 129-134.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://toolingup.stanford.edu/?page_id=123&quot;&gt;Digitization&lt;/a&gt;” in &lt;em&gt;Tooling Up for Digital Humanities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Richard Gartner, Lou Burnard, and Peter Kidd, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://cds.library.brown.edu/conferences/tei10/tei10.papers/gartner.html&quot;&gt;A TEI extension for the description of medieval manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;”, 2003.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elaine Treharne, Suzanne Paul, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ApccnEawfs&quot;&gt;Shelf  marks and catalogs&lt;/a&gt;,” 2015. (video)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;liz-fischer&quot;&gt;Liz Fischer:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Clemens and Graham reading gives a very extensive list of things that should be included in a catalog description. Supposing one has limited resources for a cataloging effort, what falls (or should fall) by the wayside? At what level of lack-of-detail does a description become useless?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What happens to descriptions when information can’t be found? How does this affect digital cataloging, specifically?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Related to both of the above: with online cataloging, to what extent can you rely on knowing your audience?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the section of Digitization that discussed TEI, the following was written:
&amp;gt; “Many initiatives such as Google Books are attempting to automate the process in order to enhance millions of digitized sources. This leads to its own set of problems, as subtle distinctions can be lost. As Worthey says, “It’s dangerous for a humanities scholar to entrust too much to a programmer or mathematician.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we balance maintaining subtlety with making the most of digital tools? How might this “loss of subtlety” make us rethink what is important to know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;christina-smith&quot;&gt;Christina Smith:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A somewhat broad question: If, according to Clemens and Graham, the work of a paleographer depends upon careful attention to the physical characteristics of a folio, how might we–as makers and users of digital technology–simulate the workings of a real page?  Here I note attempts at using a “page flipping” feature.  This also got me to thinking about the need for a repository to have a “full size” button which allows one to view the full size of the manuscript on the screen, even if it covers more than what the screen can see in one fell swoop (rather than ‘full size’ which usually just blows up the manuscript to the dimensions of the computer screen, without thought to the differing sizes in manuscripts which can tell us a lot about production and use).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A more specific question: In Elaine Treharne and Suzanne Paul’s video on shelf marks, Suzanne mentions that shelf marks are, themselves, a medieval invention.  How might we digitally represent where a medieval book was kept on its shelf (or, does this even do anything productive)?  Suzanne also mentions that one must often try to search for misspellings of names/collections (ie: Cotton Nero, etc.) in order to find as much information as they can find on a given manuscript.  Otherwise, she says, large quantities of information/resources can be left out.  How might our technologies accommodate these misspellings and correct spellings–all in one–so that a user can access as much material together at once?  (I’m not phrasing this well, but hopefully will be able to say it clearly in class tomorrow).&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Fellow Travelers: The Canterbury Tales and IIIF</title>
   <link href="http://blalbrit.github.io/2015/07/14/fellow-travelers-the-canterbury-tales-and-iiif"/>
   <updated>2015-07-14T08:00:10-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://blalbrit.github.io/2015/07/14/fellow-travelers-the-canterbury-tales-and-iiif</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Albritton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who study medieval texts are often faced with the fact that multiple versions of those texts exist in manuscripts scattered across collections, libraries, institutions, and sometimes continents. The rapid growth of availability of digital images of those manuscripts affords scholars and students the opportunity to compare witnesses more easily than in decades past, when we relied on scratchy microfilm copies or expensive in-person visits to the physical manuscripts. As valuable as online images are, we are still struggling with usability: both what we want to do, and how we want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interoperability, that unwieldy buzzword that has nearly as many definitions as practitioners, provides one path on the road toward a true digital medieval studies. In this context, the term means: the ability of software tools to use content from anywhere on the web through common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than diving into the details of such a vague statement here, let’s pose a question: “What if I wanted to compare the opening pages of the &lt;em&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/em&gt; from two different manuscripts?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/group/dmstech/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hunt_nlw_copy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-77&quot; src=&quot;/assets/hunt_nlw_copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hunt_nlw_copy&quot; width=100% /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Hengwrt and Ellesmere Chaucer mss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to that question are varied. A researcher could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up two different web sites in a browser (see screen caps above of those of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdl.huntington.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15150coll7/id/2838&quot;&gt;Huntington Library&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/HCH00001/physical?div=15&amp;amp;subdiv=0&amp;amp;locale=en&amp;amp;mode=reference&quot;&gt;National Library of Wales&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare published facsimiles – putting printed images side-by-side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire copies of images from the books and compare them on one&#39;s own computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But what if there was another (possibly better) way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iiif.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IIIF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectmirador.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mirador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; width: 100%; height: 100%; padding-bottom: 80%;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;http://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/m2/index_chaucer.html&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this demo in its native environment &lt;a href=&quot;http://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/m2/index_chaucer.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demo opens with the General Prologue of the &lt;em&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/em&gt; from two of the most famous Chaucer manuscripts: the Ellesmere Chaucer held at the Huntington Library (MS El 26 C 9) and the Hengwrt Chaucer held at the National Library of Wales (Peniarth MS 392). These images aren&#39;t being rehosted here at Stanford, they are coming directly from their home institutions (so the hosts can track usage of these images). The embedded version of this demo is somewhat limited, so follow the link to the full example &lt;a href=&quot;http://dms-data.stanford.edu/data/m2/index_chaucer.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are we looking at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each institution has published some data (a &#39;manifest&#39;) that lets us know where to find the image files for each object, as well as additional information like the sequence of the images, some description, page labels - just enough information to drive a piece of viewing software like the one in the demo above. They have also made their images available via the IIIF image API - a set of rules that allows many different types of software to access images held at different institutions the same way. So, we are seeing images coming from Los Angeles and Aberystwyth in a viewer hosted at Stanford. Because of this arrangement, it may take some time for one of the manuscripts to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where content is everywhere online, being able to access that material in predictable ways and re-use it has become extremely important. The list of libraries, museums, and other institutions supporting the IIIF image API is growing rapidly - which means that we, as users of those images, are benefitting from a surge of development to produce tools that take advantage of a wide swath of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about Mirador&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirador is one such tool (there are others, see the IIIF website for more), and its specialty is comparison: across folios, across objects, across collections, across repositories... It allows multiple viewing modes, as many viewing windows as your screen real-estate will allow, and has emerging annotation components for reading and creating annotations (the latter functionality is not turned on in this demo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirador allows us, in a simple demo like this, the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zoom in to any detail using the plus/minus buttons (or mouse scroll)&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/group/dmstech/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/controls.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-75&quot; src=&quot;/assets/controls.png&quot; alt=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;114&quot; height=&quot;77&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work through the text page by page, comparing details like decoration, paleography, textual variants, etc. (use the arrow keys to move sequentially through the books)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examine one book in detail (or two, as the embedded viewer above demonstrates)&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/group/dmstech/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/single_page.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-69&quot; src=&quot;/assets/single_page-300x208.png&quot; alt=&quot;single_page&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examine one book as a series of openings, something many manuscript scholars prefer to the &quot;disembodied page&quot; image approach &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/group/dmstech/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/opening.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-67&quot; src=&quot;/assets/opening-300x207.png&quot; alt=&quot;opening&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch to a thumbnail view to navigate within the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/group/dmstech/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/thumbnails_use.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-65&quot; src=&quot;/assets/thumbnails_use-300x207.png&quot; alt=&quot;thumbnails_use&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add in a third manuscript for comparison (or four, or five...)&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.stanford.edu/group/dmstech/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3up.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-71&quot; src=&quot;/assets/3up-300x207.png&quot; alt=&quot;3up&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirador, like the other IIIF-compliant viewers that are being developed, provides a number of different options for working with content online. This short video provides a little bit more information about navigating through the tool and its options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9b1ReCZh9-E&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Make Your Own Comparison Demo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about the IIIF approach to shared content is that it lowers the barriers to building light-weight demonstrations like this for teaching and research purposes. The institutions that host the images are on the hook for long-term access and preservation, so it&#39;s not necessary to host your own copies of the images. Further, the viewing software that is available is primarily free and open-source. So how do you make your own Chaucer (or anything else) comparison demo? A few simple steps get you up and running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Mirador (or a comparable &lt;a href=&quot;http://showcase.iiif.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IIIF-compliant viewer&lt;/a&gt;) either on your own machine or deployed on the web (code available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IIIF/mirador&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;). There are instructions for installation in the README and on the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IIIF/mirador/wiki#for-integrators&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the IIIF manifests for the content you want to add to your instance. In this case, the two Chaucer manuscript manifests can be found at:
&lt;ol&gt;

Bodmer 48, via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/fmb/cb-0048&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-codices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add these manifests to your Mirador instance by:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding them through the &quot;Add new object from URL&quot; box, which temporarily adds the manuscripts to your workspace, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure your index.html file to include those manifests all the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s pretty much it. The trick, as you might imagine, is finding out where the manifests are for the manuscripts you&#39;re interested in. The community is starting to come to grips with this issue, but at the moment it&#39;s not terribly easy. Good IIIF partners like e-codices or the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Bodleian&lt;/a&gt; site from Oxford University provide the manifest URL as part of the metadata for each of their objects (Oxford even gives us a IIIF logo as a guide to the manifest, which is very helpful as a visual signal to users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could imagine building course- or publication-specific instances of a demonstration like this - something that would provide a starting premise and context (two Chaucer manuscripts showing the same text, for instance), but allow students, readers, or casual viewers the ability to explore such a juxtaposition in new, interesting, and hopefully unexpected ways. There are thousands of manuscripts available now from interoperable repositories that can be used, and - with more institutions joining IIIF each year - thousands more in the offing. As the tools get easier to use and configure, it will be fascinating to see what becomes possible for medieval studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re already seeing a number of scholars and projects taking advantage of the opportunities offered by IIIF (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lombardpress.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Witt, at Loyola University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblissima-condorcet.fr/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Biblissima project&lt;/a&gt; to name two, alongside platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slu.edu/x99068.xml?%20site=desktop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Broken Books&lt;/a&gt; at Saint Louis University). What could you do in your own practice with resources and tools like these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other online resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His list of lyrics associated with the &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Fonteinne Amoureuse&lt;/i&gt; have been discussed elsewhere, and, as Earp states, &quot;Hoepffner&#39;s notes relating &lt;i&gt;Fonteinne&lt;/i&gt; to various lyrical poems have been treated more cautiously by more recent scholars.&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8393827287363553152#edn1&quot; name=&quot;ednref1&quot;

– a relationship that has not been described previously, and one which raises interesting questions about the role of self-borrowing in this context.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

concludes with the departure of a nobleman for a foreign land and, as Deborah McGrady has shown, explores the shifting relationship between poet and patron during the mid-fourteenth century.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8393827287363553152#edn2&quot;

&lt;/span&gt;Further complicating the relationship between poet and patron, however, is the way Machaut represents the authorship of the lyrical insertions (of which there are three) in the narrative poem.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In all cases, he gives pride of authorship to others:&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;twice to the nobleman and once to the Lady.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/span&gt;The rondel in the &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Fonteinne Amoureuse&lt;/i&gt; is actually a restructuring of Machaut’s ballade &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Loange&lt;/i&gt;

or &quot;b&quot;) but by borrowing from different parts of the structure of the parent ballade.&amp;nbsp; The Rondel achieves its form through knowledge of its citational origin.&amp;nbsp; &quot;A/a&quot; segments are drawn from the first line of each stanza of the parent ballade, &quot;B&quot; segments are drawn from the ballade refrain, and the sole &quot;b&quot; segment is drawn from an internal line from the third stanza.&amp;nbsp; That is, the distinction between A/a and B/b segments in the Rondel arises from the their original location in the parent ballade (first line of a stanza vs. non-first line), with the B/b distinction being between the structurally important refrain (ie. final stanza line) or a simple interior line (see comparison below). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Relationships of Rondel Fonteinne 3 to Ballade Loange 17&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ballade:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Ou pais ou ma dame maint&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Sont mi desir et mi penser&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Et mes cuers qui pas ne se feint&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;De li bien server et amer&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Car il ne fait fors que penser&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A s’onneur qui toute autre veint&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Et je aussi pour li honnourer&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;

Nonetheless, the narrative context of this lyric insertion, its complete reliance (for both content and, as I have shown, formal construction) on an existing work, and its use within a complicated exposition on the relationship between poet and patron and between fictional author and real author, suggests that it may have resonated with a specific audience in the chronological immediacy of its initial composition - especially in the early 1360s and for the likely nobleman depicted in the poem, Jean, duc de Berry.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8449032x/f51.item&quot;

While &quot;Ou pais ou ma dame maint&quot; does fit into this larger context of lyrical insertions, the fact that it is demonstrably a structural re-working of an earlier poem begs for additional readings which take into account resonances with other works, adding those referential layers on to our understanding of the &lt;i&gt;Fonteinne&lt;/i&gt;. This lyric insertion serves a structural and narrative role, in this instance, but also raises questions about structure, citational meanings, and text/audience interactions that might lead to reappraisals of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the place of contrasting rhyme in the definition of a generic form in a lyric poem &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the relationship of the Fonteinne to the matrix of lyrical and narrative poems with which its audience would have been familiar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and, especially, to those poems with which it is most frequently transmitted in the collected-works manuscripts of Machaut&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and finally, to the role of audience recognition when transformed works appear in a new context - what is communicated in such instances, and how would reception of the work be effected by such recognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Postscript:&lt;/h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;All of the image examples in this post were created from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallica.bnf.fr/&quot;

   <title>Machaut Data Part 1</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Introduction &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested in the fourteenth-century French poet and composer Guillaume de Machaut, one resource has remained indispensable for the last seventeen years:&amp;nbsp; Lawrence Earp&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/Guillaume_De_Machaut.html?id=GQLpI9E4dUsC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guillaume de Machaut: A Guide to Research&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Garland Publishing Inc., 1995).&amp;nbsp; The brilliance of the book lies in the fact that Earp went far beyond even the stated goal, articulated in his preface to the volume, of &quot;a guide to secondary sources&quot; [p. xii].&amp;nbsp; No, what he did - for the field - was provide a framework for organizing the objects of study (source manuscripts, works, documentary evidence) as a preliminary step to navigation of the body of secondary sources that had been produced up to the time of publication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machaut studies is rife with alternate numbering systems, with some works having two or three competing identifiers, some manuscripts bearing multiple sigla, etc.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;A Guide to Research&lt;/i&gt; provided, in a single volume, a clarification of the primary sources and the conceptual works contained in them.&amp;nbsp; This didn&#39;t necessarily make it easier for later authors to easily index the Machaut corpus in their own publications (as Elizabeth Eva Leach has discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://eeleach.wordpress.com/2010/12/23/publishing-a-scholarly-book/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but it provides a handy cross-reference for anyone working in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No publication has rivaled Earp&#39;s guide in nearly two decades, and there does not appear to be a revised edition on the horizon (though I would be happy to hear otherwise).&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, publication on Machaut has continued apace (or increased, with major articles, collections, and monographs appearing regularly, and a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://machaut.exeter.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;complete edition&lt;/a&gt; in the works).&amp;nbsp; New recordings of Machaut&#39;s music continue to be produced, and the burgeoning digitization efforts of national and academic libraries and specialist sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diamm.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DIAMM&lt;/a&gt; mean that high-resolution facsimiles of the manuscript sources are increasingly available (an up-to-date list of available digitized facsimiles of Machaut sources can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanford.edu/group/dmstech/cgi-bin/drupal/machautmss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This situation got me thinking about the relationship humanities scholars have to the data that we work with.&amp;nbsp; As more of our work takes place in the digital world, how do we translate a massive effort, like Earp&#39;s, into an ongoing, sustainable, and extensible dataset?&amp;nbsp; How do we enable others in the field to aggregate snapshots of the state of research?&amp;nbsp; How do we make our digital resources useful and, more importantly, how do we express the relationships between them in a way that is not dependent on a single scholar (or team of scholars) for maintenance and updating?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earp&#39;s guide remains relevant because the basic description of resources it provides remains accessible (though increasingly expensive if one were to try to buy the printed object now).&amp;nbsp; While the list of secondary sources is increasingly out of date, the delivery technology will remain functional for generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the digital world, we have to flip that expectation.&amp;nbsp; Delivery technologies will change - and they will change rapidly.&amp;nbsp; A Machaut-oriented website built today will not have a 100-year lifespan.&amp;nbsp; It won&#39;t have a 50-year lifespan.&amp;nbsp; It probably won&#39;t even have a 17-year lifespan.&amp;nbsp; Rather than focus on the delivery mechanism, we should focus on building extensible data and using robust ontologies, standards, and common identifiers for our primary objects.&amp;nbsp; Further, we should be publishing those datasets freely for re-use by others so that the information available in our areas of interest becomes part of a growing network of data that can be assembled, aggregated, re-used, expanded.&amp;nbsp; The value is not in creating the next &quot;online Earp&quot; or something similar, the value is in building a framework of identifiers so that new resources can be added to the collection, new relationships expressed between resources,&amp;nbsp; scholarly by-products (transcription and analysis) be integrated into the network of information - and so that we can easily take a snap-shot of that network of information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argument is not new.&amp;nbsp; This approach is not new. However, we don&#39;t seem to be seeing a lot of uptake in humanities projects for any number of reasons, including the underlying values of humanities scholars and entrenched structures of evaluation for promotion. However, the technologies are emerging and scholarship outside of the humanities is making increased use of them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://linkeddata.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Linked data&lt;/a&gt; provides a tempting approach for building a Machaut data framework - with enough freely available tools to provide access to that data in ways that might be useful in the near term and could easily be replaced as new tools supersede them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this series of posts, I will document the creation of a graph of data for Machaut studies focusing on a subset of the resources that form the objects of study:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;manuscript sources containing Machaut&#39;s works&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;works attributed to (or likely authored by) Machaut&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;works not by Machaut but that appear in manuscript sources alongside his works&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;documentary evidence about Machaut, his works, or the manuscripts sources containing them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I will use existing tools to visualize this data - starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Simile Exhibit tools&lt;/a&gt;, though possibly exploring others along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a caveat - I&#39;m new to a lot of this, so will be learning along the way.&amp;nbsp; I want to produce something useful to the field, with data that can be re-used by others.&amp;nbsp; In the next post, I will talk about building the data for a list of the manuscript sources containing Machaut&#39;s works.&amp;nbsp; A preliminary snapshot of that data is &lt;a href=&quot;http://guillaumedemachaut.com/machautdata/machautsources.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but this is really just a first pass - dates, provenance, choice of ontology, etc. still need some thought and will probably be revised multiple times in the months ahead (clicking on the &quot;scissors&quot; icon on the right-hand side of the page in the link above will give access to the data as it stands right now).</content>
