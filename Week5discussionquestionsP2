Week 5 discussion questions, part 2

1.) It's my understanding that, based on the online readings, DigiPal allows one to search within a given MS for handwriting only, if certain tags have already been set. Is this correct? Also, does it really *only* apply to c.1000-1100 (c. William the Conqueror time-period)? Are there other programs that are date-specific like this one? 
2.) In the article about "Shared Canvas," we find mention of the authenticity of the "digital surrogate" -- important for any humanist, particularly since many won't get to interact with the object in person, and this could be their only interaction as such (at least for  the time being). The article addresses the need for standardization in providing a description of digital resources. The question, for me at least, is how can/will this be implemented? I completely agree with the overall idea, for it will make research in the field much easier, and permit more interaction between digital resources if they are all described in a similar way. Does there need to be training? What has been the response from institutions not a part of this discussion since the document came out?

Interesting note, and question, from latter article: Only 1% of medieval documents have been digitized (And my question: does 'document' refer to any MS?).
